Verifying the index using xapian-delve
--------------------------------------

Xapian comes with a handy utility called `xapian-delve` which can be used to
inspect a database, so let's look at the one you just built. If you just
pass a database path as a parameter you'll get an overview: how many documents,
average term length, and some other statistics:

.. code-block:: none

    $ xapian-delve db
    UUID = 1820ef0a-055b-4946-ae73-67aa4ef5c226
    number of documents = 100
    average document length = 186.04
    document length lower bound = 8
    document length upper bound = 712
    highest document id ever used = 102
    has positional information = true
    currently open for writing = false

You can also look at an individual document, using Xapian's docid (``-d``
means output document data as well):

.. code-block:: none

    $ xapian-delve -r 1 -d db       # output has been reformatted
    Data for record #1:
    {
       "id_NUMBER" : "1896-16-14",
       "DATE_MADE" : "1660â€“70",
       "MATERIALS" : "black;red;crayon;brush;white;heightening;bluegrey;paper",
       "NAME_unused" : "",
       "WHOLE_PART_unused" : "",
       "TITLE" : "Study of a nude elderly man, Bacchus or one of his companions",
       "MEASUREMENTS" : "428 x 668 mm",
       "DESCRIPTION" : "Figure crowned with vine leaves is shown sitting upon stone which is covered by cloth. Lower part of body and head are shown in profile, whereas chest is turned toward front, the left arm crossing right leg. Raised right hand is leaned upon staff.",
       "COLLECTION" : "Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum",
       "PLACE_MADE_unused" : "",
       "MAKER" : "Giovanni Battista Merano"
    }

You can also go the other way, starting with a term and finding both
statistics and which documents it indexes:

.. code-block:: none

    $ xapian-delve -t Stime db
    Posting List for term 'Stime' (termfreq 1, collfreq 1, wdf_max 1): 81

This means you can look documents up by identifier:

.. code-block:: none

    $ xapian-delve -t Q1896-16-14 db
    Posting List for term 'Q1896-16-14' (termfreq 1, collfreq 0, wdf_max 0): 1

``xapian-delve`` is frequently useful if you aren't getting the behaviour you
expect from a search system, to check that the database contains the
documents and terms you expect.
